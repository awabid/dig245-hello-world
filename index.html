<h2>Awais Abid</h2>
<h3>Junior, Computer Science major</h3>
<h4>Why this course</h4>
<p> I'm taking this course because I enjoy web development,
   and I hope to develop a better understanding of web design,
    and how web apps function.

</p>
<h4>Previous Experience</h4>
<p>In the past, I've used basic web development tools, like Wordpress
  and Dreamweaver, to create websites for my own projects. As a CS major,
  I've taken advanced programming courses and am comfortable with
  data structures, OOP, game mechanics, etc in Java, C++, C#, and Python.
</p>
<h4>Goals for this Course</h4>
<p>By the end of this course, I hope to be comfortable reconstructing modern
  web functionalities, like animations, as well as possessing an understanding of quirky web technologies
and how they can support different sociocultural projects Im working on. </p>

<h4>Summary of Learn-Computing activities</h4>
<p>I completed multiple learn-computing activities. In the Command line activity,
I got a recap of how the Mac terminal works, basic commands, and how I can
navigate directories using ls/cd, etc. In the File Naming Conventions activity, I learned better
naming practices, like camelCase and kebab-case, and why they're neccessary for
hassle-free coding and file organization. In the Git version control acitvity, I got a recap of
basic git functions, and how forking, cloning, and push/pull works. Also learnt why its useful
to use a file management system like Git.
</p>

<h5>Projects I'm interested in</h5>
<p>1. Hate with Friends</p> <a href="https://www.hatewithfriends.com/">Link</a>
<p>This site lets you connect to Facebook and choose friends you hate, and discover
the ones who hate you back. I love this because of the way it manipulates a social tool like Facebook
and demonstrates how the same features that it uses for positivity can be easily
turned into less pleasant tools.</p>
<p>2. Species in Pieces</p> <a href="http://species-in-pieces.com/">
  <img src="https://unmatchedstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/species-in-pieces-animals.jpg"><br>Link</a>
<p>This site illustrates endangered species using beautiful, interactive piece-based web art.
Not only is it visually stunning, using just 30 vectors to create images, it offers a dark look at
the reality of endangered animals. It offers an engaging way to educate people about an important topic.</p>
<p>3. The Wiki Game</p> <a href="https://www.thewikigame.com/group">Link</a>
<p>This is a quirky game that gives you a wikipedia article, and a goal article, which you must reach
by navigating the links in the given article. Its remarkable how this game pushes you
to make connections between two vastly different concepts and figure out how they
could be linked. In a sense, it almost makes you think like an AI.</p>
<p> <strong> All three of these sites prove how simple web design techniques can create out-of-the-ordinary projects. As Albert Einstein said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>“If at first the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it.” </blockquote>
<pre> That's all for now!</pre>
